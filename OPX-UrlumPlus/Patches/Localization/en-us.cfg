		// Picna
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Picna_Name = Picna^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Picna_Desc = Picna is a moon orbiting just beneath Polta and Priax, and seems to be otherwise fairly unremarkable. History has taught, however, that what seems unremarkable very rarely is. 
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Picna_Biome_P = Poles
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Picna_Biome_SM = Stretching Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Picna_Biome_B = Bulges

		// Hock
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Hock_Name = Hock^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Hock_Desc = The largest moon of Urlum's ring system, Hock is a ravioli-shaped moon orbiting within the densest portion if it. Hock's equator is covered in a large ridge of collected ring particles.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Hock_Biome_ER = Equatorial Ridge
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Hock_Biome_C = Core
		
		// Dathil
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Name = Dathil^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Desc = Dathil, the second major moon of Urlum, exhibits an extensive canyon system on its surface. These likely formed from thermal expansion and contraction that caused cracks in the crust during the early formation of the moon. The surface crust opens up to reveal white rock beneath the canyons, and many scientists believe some may be covered with a thin layer of ice. Like Wal, the surface of Dathil contains rock dating back to the formation of the Urlum system.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Biome_L = Lowlands

		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Biome_EC = Epic Cliffs
		
		// Biscotti
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Biscotti_Name = Biscotti^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Biscotti_Desc = Biscotti is probably the most recent body in the solar system. Discovered as the brightest moon of Urlum, it was at first mistaken for the nearby star Parsec before a square-head figured out that it was nowhere nearby. With improving telescopic technology a faint disk of dust was discovered, though the true nature of this moon remains to be seen.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Biscotti_Biome_N = Neck
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Biscotti_Biome_S = Slopes
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Biscotti_Biome_AL = α Lobe
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Biscotti_Biome_BL = β Lobe
		
		// Tal
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Tal_Biome_RR = Ripley Region^N
		
		// Wal
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Wal_Desc = Wal is the largest of Urlum's moons, after the fairy king Wal from Quaksord Kerman's "A Hot Summer Night." With its strange two-toned coloration and its own submoon, many have speculated that the moon also features a ring system of its own; possibly the only of its kind in the solar system. The orbit of Tal also revealed that it is surprisingly dense for a body of its size, thus meaning it may have migrated from somewhere inward of Jool.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Wal_Biome_R = Cacao Planitia^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Wal_Biome_I = Wanil Plantia^N

		// Lyxis
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Name = Lyxis
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Desc = Lyxis, the outermost moon of Urlum, is a large, very distantly orbiting captured object with a horrifically distorted surface. Thought to have originated as a centaur similar to Pab or Crokslev, Lyxis was likely captured in the latter days of the formation of the Kerbolar System, and suffered a great number of impacts. A mission here would be of great interest due to the age of its surface. 
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Biome_FC = Fachas Crater
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Biome_EET = Eastern Elevated Terrain
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Biome_WET = Western Elevated Terrain

		// Pab
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Pab_Name = 2065 Pab^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Pab_Desc = Pab is a silly little asteroid orbiting in between Sarnus and Urlum. It is the Pibbiest, some say, but others say it is the Pabbiest. Reportedly, this name was given after Lemus Kerman's infant daughter made this noise while pointing it out to him on a star chart.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Pab_Biome_ER = Equatorial Ridge
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Pab_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Pab_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Pab_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Pab_Biome_C = Crevasses
		
		// Pymm
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Pymm_Name = (2065) 1 Pymm^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Pymm_Desc = Pymm is Pab's silly little moon, named for Pab's sister in a popular series of children's books. However, it is unknown if Pymm itself is a blood sister or an adoptive syster to Pab, considering that it orbits in the opposite direction relative to Pab.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Pymm_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Pymm_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Pymm_Biome_H = Highlands
		
		// Halas
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Halas_Name = 687170 Halas
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Halas_Desc = 687170 Halas is a rare example of a trojan asteroid which is not tied to Jool. Halas seems broadly unremarkable besides this, but some cranks have decided that it is the site of a gateway to another universe. Is it? Probably not, but worth checking. 
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Halas_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Halas_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Halas_Biome_L = Lowlands
		
		// Research Bodies
		#LOC_OPX-UP_RB_Dathil = Hey look, it's another Polta! Said no one ever. This is going to be very interesting to explore. Let's call it Dathil after the idiotic fairy from Kakespeare's stories. I'm sure this won't start a trend.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_RB_Lyxis = What is this thing DOING out there? Its so far away and so inclined that theres no way it formed there. Was it captured or flung out? Let's name it Lyxis. Why? I dunno.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_RB_Pab = It's pretty far out there, but somehow light enough that a kid discovered it. It's on a decently interesting orbit too, but not too bad. For her sake, let's call this Pab, like the sound she made finding it.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_RB_Pymm = So, it turns out Pab has a companion here? Let's name it Pymm, like Pab's pet dog in The Saltwater Taffy.
		
		// Tarsier Tech
		#LOC_OPX-UP_TT_Dathil = Whoa thats a lot of canyons.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_TT_Lyxis = Why is this thing here?
		#LOC_OPX-UP_TT_Picna = Ooooh, pointy!
		#LOC_OPX-UP_TT_Hock = bruh
		#LOC_OPX-UP_TT_Biscotti = I'm seeing double.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_TT_Pab = It looks like ice cream... strange.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_TT_Pymm = It looks like more ice cream... strange.
