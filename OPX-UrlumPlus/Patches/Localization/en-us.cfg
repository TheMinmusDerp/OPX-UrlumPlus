		// Jool
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Name = Jool
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Desc = Jool is particularly known for being a rather large, predominantly green planet. Kerbalkind has longed to visit the first gas giant in the home system ever since it was first spotted in the sky. Philosophers reason that the swirling titan must be a really nice place to visit, on account of its wholesome coloration. \n\nThis was further backed up by the future discovery and exploration of the five Joolian moons, one of them being a seemingly Kerbin-like world offering breathable air, water, land and a great view of the green giant.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Biome_NP = North Pole
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Biome_NPB = North Polar Belt
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Biome_NTZ = North Temperate Zone
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Biome_NTB = North Tropical Belt
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Biome_EqZ = Equatorial Zone
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Biome_STB = South Tropical Belt
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Biome_STZ = South Temperate Zone
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Biome_SPB = South Polar Belt
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jool_Biome_SP = South Pole
		
		// Meto
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Meto_Name = Meto
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Meto_Desc = Meto is the closest moon to Jool, orbiting just above its rareified upper atmosphere. Little is known about it, as it moves so fast it is hard to get a good picture. But scientists have confirmed that the moon is likely held together solely by its own tensile strength, and we're not sure how long it'll last. Visit it while you can! Bring grappling hooks though.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Meto_Biome_C = Crevasses
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Meto_Biome_P = Poles
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Meto_Biome_S = Surface
		
		// Alnes
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Alnes_Name = Alnes^N
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Alnes_Desc = The largest inner moon of Jool, Alnes is a medium-sized asteroidal object beneath the orbit of Laythe. Ground-based telescopes can see very little beyond a stark red coloration against the brilliant green clouds of its parent planet. A mission is advised to learn what causes this bright, unique coloration.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Alnes_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Alnes_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Alnes_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Alnes_Biome_IC = Impact Crater
		
		// Klip
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Klip_Name = Klip^N
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Klip_Desc = Klip is the outermost major moon of Jool, and is commonly regarded as the least interesting by uninformed laykerbals. Despite this perception, even ground-based telescopes can detect hints of unique features on the moon's surface. Due to its distance from Jool, Klip's surface is believed to be the oldest in the Kerbol System, preserving surface features as old as the moon itself. 
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Klip_Biome_L = Lowlands

		#LOC_OPX-JP_Klip_Biome_NM = Nyerna Massif
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Klip_Biome_CH = Chaotic Highlands
		
		// Surface biome of all pseudobodies
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Common_Biome_S = Surface
		
		// Rator
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Rator_Name = I1-Rator
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Rator_Desc = Rator is the smallest known moon of Jool, and barely qualifies as more than a minor asteroid. It is believed to be the main contributor of material to Jool's sparse rings, but we don't know much else about it.
		
		// Jimel
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jimel_Name = P1-Jimel
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jimel_Desc = The second largest of the outer moons of Jool, Jimel is a a large irregular satellite orbiting prograde. It is the seventh largest Joolian satellite, but you'd have to go there to find anything else about it.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jimel_Biome_C = Craters
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jimel_Biome_EH = Equatorial High
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jimel_Biome_EL = Equatorial Low
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Jimel_Biome_P = Poles
		
		// Colwin
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Colwin_Name = P2-Colwin
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Colwin_Desc = The third largest of the outer moons, Colwin is a small object orbiting in the vicinity of Jimel far beyond the major moons. That's about all we know.
		
		// Diem
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Diem_Name = P3-Diem
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Diem_Desc = I'm sure this one will be very fun and productive to reach and explore. Have fun, kids!
		
		// Vlad
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Vlad_Name = P4-Vlad^N
		#LOC_OPX-JP_Vlad_Desc = A lil dot in the sky that we saw once. We're pretty sure it's there.
		
		// Research Bodies
		#LOC_OPX-JP_RB_Jool = Well... Guys, we discovered Jool, a big kerb... planet, gas planet.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_RB_Meto = I think I've gone blind from all the squinting it took to find this thing.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_RB_Alnes = Reminds me of the disappointment we all felt when we found that Duna wasn't snacks.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_RB_Klip = Well that's a lot of craters. This'll be fun for someone else to explore.
  
		// Tarsier Tech
		#LOC_OPX-JP_TT_Jool = Ah, a featureless green sphere. Reminds me of my-[this statement has been redacted by the public relations authority]
		#LOC_OPX-JP_TT_Meto = How did we find this thing? 
		#LOC_OPX-JP_TT_Alnes = If this was anything less than extremely red, we wouldn't be able to see it.
		#LOC_OPX-JP_TT_Klip = Wow. That's a lot of craters. I'm sure glad that's someone else's problem.
