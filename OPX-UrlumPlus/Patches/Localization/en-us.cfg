		// Urlum
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Urlum_Name = Urlum^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Urlum_Desc = It took a while for Kerbal astronomers to realize Urlum was not a far away star, but in fact another planet. Since then scientists have been weary of making claims about Urlum, for fear of being wrong yet again. The ice giant is unusual in that it rotates around its axis in a clockwise fashion, unlike the anti-clockwise rotation of the other planets.
        #LOC_OPX-UP_Urlum_Biome_PZ = Polar Zones
        #LOC_OPX-UP_Urlum_Biome_TB = Tropical Belts
        #LOC_OPX-UP_Urlum_Biome_EZ = Equatorial Zone
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Urlum_Biome_TZ = Temperate Zones
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Urlum_Biome_TeB = Temperate Belts
		
		// Picna
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Picna_Name = Picna^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Picna_Desc = Picna is a moon orbiting just beneath Polta and Priax, and seems to be otherwise fairly unremarkable. History has taught, however, that what seems unremarkable very rarely is. 
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Picna_Biome_P = Poles
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Picna_Biome_SM = Stretching Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Picna_Biome_B = Bulges
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Picna_Biome_IC = Impact Craters
		
		// Hock
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Hock_Name = Hock^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Hock_Desc = The largest moon of Urlum's ring system, Hock is a ravioli-shaped moon orbiting within the densest portion if it. Hock's equator is covered in a large ridge of collected ring particles.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Hock_Biome_ER = Equatorial Ridge
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Hock_Biome_C = Core

  		// Polta
    		#LOC_OPX-UP_Polta_Name = Polta^N
	        #LOC_OPX-UP_Polta_Desc = Polta's mint-colored appearance immediately reminded astronomers of Minmus, but it was quickly realized that that was still in orbit of Kerbin and this thus had to be another body. Polta's surface is made of smooth and swirling terrain forms, most likely a result of tidal heating caused by the nearby Urlum.
	        #LOC_OPX-UP_Polta_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Polta_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Polta_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Polta_Biome_P = Peaks
	        #LOC_OPX-UP_Polta_Biome_ZH = Zuev Hills
	        #LOC_OPX-UP_Polta_Biome_SH = Subotai Hills
	        #LOC_OPX-UP_Polta_Biome_BP = Bray Plateau
	        #LOC_OPX-UP_Polta_Biome_FP = Falkor Plains
	        #LOC_OPX-UP_Polta_Biome_EV = Eidilleg Valley
	 	#LOC_OPX-UP_Polta_Biome_JL = Jareth Labyrinth
		
		// Priax
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Priax_Name = Priax^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Priax_Desc = Priax shares the orbit of its larger cousin Polta, making it a co-orbital configuration. This strange orbit is stable because Priax is located in the libration point of the larger Polta. Priax is also characterized by its heavily cratered surface, which makes it sort of resemble lump of cheese. Whether the surface is edible has yet to be confirmed.
        #LOC_OPX-UP_Priax_Biome_BR = Badie Region
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Priax_Biome_SR = Sido Region
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Priax_Biome_C = Cracks
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Priax_Biome_GC = Great Craters
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Priax_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Priax_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Priax_Biome_H = Highlands

		// Dathil
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Name = Dathil^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Desc = Dathil, the second major moon of Urlum, exhibits an extensive canyon system on its surface. These likely formed from thermal expansion and contraction that caused cracks in the crust during the early formation of the moon. The surface crust opens up to reveal white rock beneath the canyons, and many scientists believe some may be covered with a thin layer of ice. Like Wal, the surface of Dathil contains rock dating back to the formation of the Urlum system.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Biome_P = Peaks
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Biome_IC = Impact Craters
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Biome_G = Graben
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Biome_KuC = Kunda Crater
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Biome_KeC = Kertrude Crater
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Dathil_Biome_EC = Epic Cliffs
		
		// Biscotti
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Biscotti_Name = Biscotti^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Biscotti_Desc = Biscotti is probably the most recent body in the solar system. Discovered as the brightest moon of Urlum, it was at first mistaken for the nearby star Parsec before a square-head figured out that it was nowhere nearby. With improving telescopic technology a faint disk of dust was discovered, though the true nature of this moon remains to be seen.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Biscotti_Biome_N = Neck
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Biscotti_Biome_S = Slopes
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Biscotti_Biome_AL = α Lobe
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Biscotti_Biome_BL = β Lobe
		
		// Tal
  		#LOC_OPX-UP_Tal_Name = Tal^N
	        #LOC_OPX-UP_Tal_Desc = Tal is what astronomer's call a sub-satellite. While generally these moons of moons are impossible due to too small spheres of influence, Wal's distant orbit from the ice giant Urlum allowed Tal to maintain a stable orbit. Tal's albedo indicates it is composed of metals, ice or both.
	        #LOC_OPX-UP_Tal_Biome_DR = Dunrana Region
	        #LOC_OPX-UP_Tal_Biome_SR = Sigley Region
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Tal_Biome_RR = Ripley Region^N
		
		// Wal
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Wal_Name = Wal^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Wal_Desc = Wal is the largest of Urlum's moons, after the fairy king Wal from Quaksord Kerman's "A Hot Summer Night." With its strange two-toned coloration and its own submoon, many have speculated that the moon also features a ring system of its own; possibly the only of its kind in the solar system. The orbit of Tal also revealed that it is surprisingly dense for a body of its size, thus meaning it may have migrated from somewhere inward of Jool.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Wal_Biome_R = Cacao Planitia^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Wal_Biome_I = Wanil Plantia^N
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Wal_Biome_S = Slopey Slopes^N

		#LOC_OPX-UP_Wal_Biome_VC = Vader Crater^N
		
		// Lyxis
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Name = Lyxis
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Desc = Lyxis, the outermost moon of Urlum, is a large, very distantly orbiting captured object with a horrifically distorted surface. Thought to have originated as a centaur similar to Pab or Crokslev, Lyxis was likely captured in the latter days of the formation of the Kerbolar System, and suffered a great number of impacts. A mission here would be of great interest due to the age of its surface. 
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Biome_FC = Fachas Crater
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Biome_EET = Eastern Elevated Terrain
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Biome_WET = Western Elevated Terrain
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Lyxis_Biome_DC = Deep Craters
		
		// Halas
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Halas_Name = 687170 Halas
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Halas_Desc = 687170 Halas is a rare example of a trojan asteroid which is not tied to Jool. Halas seems broadly unremarkable besides this, but some cranks have decided that it is the site of a gateway to another universe. Is it? Probably not, but worth checking. 
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Halas_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Halas_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-UP_Halas_Biome_L = Lowlands
		
		// Research Bodies
		#LOC_OPX-UP_RB_Dathil = Hey look, it's another Polta! Said no one ever. This is going to be very interesting to explore. Let's call it Dathil after the idiotic fairy from Kakespeare's stories. I'm sure this won't start a trend.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_RB_Lyxis = What is this thing DOING out there? Its so far away and so inclined that theres no way it formed there. Was it captured or flung out? Let's name it Lyxis. Why? I dunno.
		
		// Tarsier Tech
		#LOC_OPX-UP_TT_Dathil = Whoa thats a lot of canyons.
		#LOC_OPX-UP_TT_Lyxis = Why is this thing here?
		#LOC_OPX-UP_TT_Picna = Ooooh, pointy!
		#LOC_OPX-UP_TT_Hock = bruh
		#LOC_OPX-UP_TT_Biscotti = I'm seeing double.
