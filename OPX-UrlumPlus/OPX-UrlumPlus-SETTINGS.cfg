//EXPLANATIONS
//Revamps – remastered textures for Polta, Priax, Wal, and Tal respectively. Can be disabled individually, True by default
//UrlumTextureChange – The replacement Urlum texture. True by default, but added a toggle on the request of @rexxars on discord for nostalgia purposes? I guess? 
//UrlumTextureChange does not affect the ring texture, and does not work without OPM installed.
